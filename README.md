## Welcome! I'm Mohammad S.U. A Full-Stack Web Developer.
I have experience in React, TypeScript, Laravel, and SQL. I've honed my skills as the solo/lead developer of LimeDrive.net - a full-stack cloud storage/file hosting service, robust and serverless. I aim to craft cost-effective scalable solutions with exceptional user experience.

## Experience
### Solo/lead developer of full-stack cloud storage/file hosting service  –  2023 to 2024
### [LimeDrive.net](https://limedrive.net) &nbsp;–&nbsp; [Video Demo]() &nbsp;–&nbsp; [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Mohammad-SU/LimeDrive-Cloud-Storage-Public)

Solo-developed this robust cloud storage service for over a year, with some areas surpassing Dropbox/Google Drive (particularly speed). I handled all complex architectural and scalability decisions, implementing them myself. Seamlessly manage and view files in LimeDrive's sleek retro UI - secure, fast, and performant.
