## üíª Welcome! I'm Mohammad S.U. A Full-Stack Web Developer.
I have experience in React, TypeScript, Laravel, and SQL. I've honed my skills as the solo/lead developer of LimeDrive.net - a full-stack cloud storage/file hosting service, robust and serverless. I aim to craft cost-effective scalable solutions with exceptional user experience.

Solo-developed this robust cloud storage service for over a year, with some areas surpassing Dropbox/Google Drive (particularly speed).
